## Project Overview

### Overview

XP.network is a codeless platform for building blockchain agnostic NFT DApps. XP.network allows non-developers to build their NFT marketplaces, galleries, museums and many more use-cases without coding.

In order to synchronize communication between different [parachains](https://research.web3.foundation/en/latest/polkadot/XCMP/index.html) we want to build our own protocol which will be used by a network of XP.network pallets.
 
Since it is currently hard to trace whether an incoming message is related to any previous transaction or request, we will elaborate a protocol that will enable such tracking by the "TOPIC ID". It will be a group of pallets, each acting like a “post office” from a post office network. They will all use our XP Relay Chain protocol.

Since different blockchains may use different smart contract languages, we are aspiring to create an automated toolbox that will communicate via the Polkadot Relay Chain and will generate in the target pallet a valid code in Move, Solidity and Rust (Ink!) which could be further validated and compiled to byte-code to interact with the target blockchains. After the target blockchain has finished or rejected the transaction, the information about this is packed back into the reply XP Relay Chain protocol message and is sent back to the requesting pallet for passing it to the requesting blockchain.

Because there's no NFT library in Move's standard library we will have to write it as part of this project. This will allow 
1. other blockchains to call NFT smart contracts in Move, 
2. to run NFT smart contracts in other languages from Move.

#### Integration

All the NFT based applications built by our platform will be using the XP Relay Chain protocol we're building.

The pallets (one for each parahcain / parathread) will act as a “post office network” supporting the protocol that enables nodes to keep track of the “topics”. They will also "translate" the intentions of one parachain, regardless of its smart contract language, to a smart contract in the language of the target parachain / parathread.

### Project Details

**XP Relay Chain Protocol** will be supported by a number of pallets, each acting as a “post office”. A typical message will include:
```terminal
{
ID:                 id,               //required to identify that the other blockchain’s reply is related to this request,
CallbackFunction:   funcName,         // a designated Polkadot Relay Chain callback function,
CallbackArguments:  [ ... ],          // required for the above function,
To:                 dest,             // indicates the destination parachain / parathread,
Payload:            blob              // A binary representation of the "intention"
}
```

The message inside the binary payload will be structured as follows:

![img](https://github.com/xp-network/w3f_application/blob/main/XP.network.protocol.png)

The **XP.network Handshake protocol** will look like this:

1. An initiating pallet sends a message with a smart contract call to a designated pallet.
2. Once the designated pallet receives the message it unpacks the blob from the payload and returns the confirmation like this:

   a. it swaps the Source & the Destination addresses
   
   b. it flips the AKN flag from 0 to 1, keeping the other flags in the off state
   
   c. it checks whether the template of the desired type exists and the argument list matches the requirement. In case at least one does not, the DER (destination error) and END flags are set to 1.
   
   c. it keeps the rest of the blob intact to prove to the sender that exactly this message was received.
   
   d. it crafts a Message with the same ID and sends it back for the initiator to confirm that the transaction is being processed or failed.
   
4. The initiating pallet checks the integrity of the parcel and whether END or DER flags were not raised and if everything is ok will return the same message (with swapped Sender & Receiver) with the INT(egrity) flag set to 1. Otherwise the INT(egrity) flag will remain 0, but NER(nework error) flag will be raised to indicate that the message was corrupted in the transport layer.
5. Once the message with the Topic_ID arrives to the destination pallet it will check the inegrity flag and if the flag is 1 it will start processing the request. Otherwise, it will retrun the same message, acknowledging broken integrity and proving that the transaction is terminated.
6. Once the request has been processed, submited to the target blockchain and a success / failure result is received form the blockchain, it will craft a new message with the same Topic_ID setting the OK or REJ flags as well as the END flag to 1.
7. Once the above message is received by the initiating pallet it will check its integrity and will pass the result to its blockchain. It will then send the same message back to the counterpart to finish negotiation on the Topic_ID.
8. IER stands for Initiator pallet error. This flag will be raised if there is a technical issue in the initiating pallet.

Every parachain equipped with our pallet will know how to read such incoming messages. If the message is related to the blockchain this pallet is attached to, it will do the following:

1. Deserialize the incoming message from bytecode to optcode,
2. Transform the commands and arguments from the optcode to a smart contract in the target language, used by the blockchain it works for.
3. It will pass the generated bytecode to the blockchain for execution.
4. Once there is a reply from the blockchain, the reply will be packed into the return message of the present protocol and sent back to the requesting pallet via 5. Polkadot Relay Chain callbacks with the same id it got the request.
6. The pallet which initiated the transaction will receive the reply and will match the id of the reply with the id of the request.
7. It will deserialize the bytecode of the reply and will transform it to the bytecode of its smart contract language (should it be different from the counterpart’s).

A pallet implementing this protocol consists of:

1. **Bytecode Deserializer** - it receives binary input and returns a human readable opcode. 
2. **Assembly Code Converter** - it  creates the following key - value pairs:
   + The chosen smart contract programming language.
   + Template number.
   + Data to populate the smart contract with.
3. **Bytecode Compiler** - it takes the key - value pairs generated at the previous stage as an input and generates the chosen smart contract language bytecode as its output.
4. **Polkadot parathread** - it uses the Relay Chain callback mechanism to communicate with the other parachains and parathreads using XP Network protocol.

A set of pre-programmed audited code templates are ready to be populated by the arbitrary data. Once a request is received, the templates are populated with the incoming data and are instantly compiled into transaction ready bytecode. Initially there will be a limited set of ready code templates for each platform. However, new templates will be added on a permanent regular basis. Eventually most possible use cases will be available for each bridged platform. Finally, the original smart contract bytecode will be translated directly into the target language bytecode, removing all limitations.

#### [PoC](https://github.com/xp-network/xp-compiler)

Before applying for the grant we have prepared GitHub repositories with the Proof of Concept.

Since the idea behind the VM Hub is converting one smart contract language bytecode to another we have elaborated the following steps:

1. We wrote a short smart contract in Solidity.
2. We compiled it to bytecode with the solc compiler.
3. We deserialized the bytecode into opcode.
4. An array of opcodes became a bytecode template:
   a. Commands (MSTORE, SSTORE, CALLVALUE, ISZERO, JUMPI, REVERT… )
   b. Data (PUSH 80, PUSH [$] 000000000000000000000000000000000000000001, etc.)
5. We wrote a request in Move which will specify which template we want to use and will provide the data to populate the template with new data.
6. The code in Move is then compiled to bytecode & passed to our Substrate pallet.
7. The pallet deserializes the Move bytecode and extracts the instruction - which template to use and the data to populate it with.
8. The data from the request is used to populate the opcode parameters in the template.
9. The template is reassembled to bytecode.
10. We run the two bytecodes (from steps 2 & 9) in the Ethereum testnet.
11. If both the smart contracts run in the testnet and produce the same result - the concept is proved.

The above process is automated and can be reproduced on any machine.

#### Expected obstacles:
For efficiency in EVM higher order bits of types narrower than 256 bits, e.g. uint24 may be ignored or cleaned shortly before writing them to memory or before comparisons. This means, before comparison or saving higher order bits must be “manually” cleaned.

In the Move language the code is divided into scripts and Modules. When scripts are compiled to the bytecode they become straightforward opcodes, however, modules can be recursively called from the scripts or from the other modules. Thus, modules deserialisation is much more complex and also requires recursiveness to retrieve the content of all the functions or data stored in different parts of the stack.

#### Further development
We cannot get rid of the target language dependency, however, the source language can be abstracted to an API protocol able to call predefined smart contracts in supported languages (Move, Solidity and Rust) from other programming languages. This may initially seem to be a limitation, but the number of actually used smart contracts is not infinite. If all or nearly all known smart contract patterns are present in the template library it will give more freedoms than limitations.

We’re planning to elaborate the most popular smart contract bytecode templates in 3 languages: Move, Solidity and Rust and write APIs for compiling and sending the resulting bytecodes to the supported blockchains.

The smart contract templates are a temporary solution. Eventually we will add the flexibility to directly translate smart contracts from one language to another without predefined templates.

### Ecosystem Fit

- The VM Hub will eventually develop to become programming language independent and will enable yet nonexistent languages to seamlessly integrate with the established blockchains via Polkadot.
